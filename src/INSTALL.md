## How to run the BlackJackChain smart contract

The BlackJackChain smart contract was coded using Solidity 0.4.26. It must be deployed on a Ethereum-based blockchain.

Once the contract started working, the player must insert into the GameBlackjack function the amount of ETH he wants to bet for this game. All the other actions will be carried out automatically by the smart contract itself.

Have a look at our presentation to have a simulation of what could happen after you started playing.
