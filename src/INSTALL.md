## How to run the BlackJackChain smart contract

The BlackJackChain smart contract was coded using Solidity 0.4.26. It must be deployed on a Ethereum-based blockchain.

When the contract starts to go, the player must insert into the *GameBlackjack()* function the amount of ETH he wants to bet. Once the game starts, the player can either select the function *Card()* to hit a card or choose the function *Stand()* to stand. At this point, the smart contract will figure out which is the best choice for the dealer. Finally, the code will comprare the hands of both players and a winner (alongside the amount of ETH he won) will be declared.

Have a look at our presentation to have a simulation of what can happen after you started playing.
