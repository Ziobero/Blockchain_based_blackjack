# Blockchain-based blackjack
This is the repository created for the group project for Fintech and Blockchain class of the Msc in Data science and Business analytics. The group is composed by:
- Bellucci Emanuele (group leader);
- Bricarelli Paolo;
- Bruno Luca;
- Nuti Silvia;
- Roscioli Dimitri.

## Goal of the project
The goal of this project is to deliver a prototype of a blockchain-based blackjack software built as an Ethereum smart contract that exploits the characteristics of Ethereum blockchain to deliver a fairer way of playing blackjack. The main advantage of this new implementation relies on its transparency:  in fact, players can see how the algorithm works behind the scenes while, in a typical blackjack software of an online casino, nobody knows whatâ€™s inside this black box (apart from the casino itself).

## File exploration
 In this GitHub repository you can find 3 different folders:
 - `\documentation` - stores a `contrib.md` file where you cand find the daily contribution of each team member;
 - `\src` -  it stores the code sources that we looked at to help us develop our BlackJackChain smart contract;
 - `\summary` - it stores a report as well as a presentation where we explain respectively the technical part and the business part of the project.
 Finally, the `BlackJackChain` file contains the code that must be compiled in the remix platform.
